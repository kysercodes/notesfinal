# RGB

###### 255 on each of the rgb created the color white
###### 127 on the G "green" creates normal green
 

  # Tertiary colors 
  
  ##### are created by combining a primary with a nearby secondary color.

  # Color Wheel

  ##### A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are further apart. For example, pure red is between the hues rose and orange.

##### Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray. But when they are placed side-by-side, these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter.

# Hex values


##### A very common way to apply color to an element with CSS is with hexadecimal or hex values. While hex values sound complicated, they're really just another form of RGB values.

##### Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue. For example, #4B5320.

##### With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).

# HSL

##### The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

##### If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

##### Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.

# Linear Gradient

##### A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.

##### gradientDirection is the direction of the line used for the transition. color1 and color2 are color arguments, which are the colors that will be used in the transition itself. These can be any type of color, including color keywords, hex, rgb, or hsl. also if n gradient direction is set 180 will be set automatically
