## Varibale Scope

###### Javascript uses lexical scoping a var defined in one area of your program may not be accessable in other areas of the program.
## Global scope
##### defined outside of all code blocks

## Local Scope
###### defined inside a code block

##### in a scope you can access vayou can access varibales defined in that scope or any parent or ancestor scope

##### if you have differnet dcopes you can name varibales the same names


## Varibale shadowing

##### when a local varibale in a local scope uses its value instead of the parent vale

## Leaked global

##### when we assign a val to variable with but that variable was never explicitly defined
