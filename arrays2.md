# Find Index vs find

##### findindex is a higher order function

##### if you are looking for something by its index to remove it find index is better to use  only differnce is what you get back

# Passed by reference

##### arrays are also passed by reference if passed to a function and changed you will see it reflected in the original array 

# Filtering 

##### creates a new array does not alter original, filter always returns an array
